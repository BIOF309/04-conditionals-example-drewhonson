    "Restriction enzymes provide an easy way to clone sequences of interest into plasmid vectors, but each restriction enzyme cuts only at a single unique site. Given that biologists have discovered and mass produced hundreds of different restriction enzymes, searching a DNA sequence manually for a useful site is impractical. As such, most sequence analysis and manipulation software contains a restriction enzyme database and a search engine to find and annotate the locations of restriction sites within a provided sequence. The program I have written below provides a simple function to identify the sites of five common enzymes in a user-provided sequence.\n",
